Friends, it’s true: the end of the decade approaches. It’s been a difficult, anxiety-provoking, morally compromised decade, but at least it’s been populated 
by some damn fine literature. We’ll take our silver linings where we can.
So, as is our hallowed duty as a literary and culture website—though with full awareness of the potentially fruitless and endlessly contestable 
nature of the task—in the coming weeks, we’ll be taking a look at the best and most important (these being not always the same) books of the decade 
that was. We will do this, of course, by means of a variety of lists. We began with the best debut novels, the best short story collections, the best 
poetry collections, and the best memoirs of the decade, and we have now reached the fifth list in our series: the best essay collections published in 
English between 2010 and 2019.ded a lThe following books were chosen after much debate (and several rounds of voting) by the Literary Hub staff. Tears were 
spilled, feelings were hurt, books were re-read. And as you’ll shortly see, we had a hard time choosing just ten—so we’ve also incluist of dissenting 
opinions, and an even longer list of also-rans. As ever, free to add any of your own favorites that we’ve missed in the comments below.
